In the first task, I employed the use of if else to obtain the two states of the numbers; odd and even.

In the second task the function uses the map method to iterate over the processed numbers array and modify each string in the strings array based on it corresponding number.
If the number is even it is capitalized using the toUpperCase method and iff it is odd it is converted to lowercase using toLowerCase method.
